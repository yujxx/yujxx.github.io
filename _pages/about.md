Hello! I am Yujia Xiao, a fourth-year PhD student in the DSP & Speech Technology Laboratory (DSP-STL) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of Prof. Tan Lee. Prior to this, I worked as an applied scientist at Microsoft from 2018 to 2022. I earned both my M.S. and B.S. degrees from South China University of Technology. My current research focuses on long-form audio and speech generation as well as multimodal agents. 

😊 I plan to graduate in 2026 and am actively seeking new opportunities in academic or industry research positions. If you are interested in my work, feel free to contact me!

I love music, enjoy singing, and play the guzheng (amateur Level 10). I’m also into podcasts, interviews, stand-up comedy, badminton, and have a strong interest in mental health, with certifications in QPR Gatekeeping and MHFA Standard Course. If we share similar interests, let’s connect and explore them together!
