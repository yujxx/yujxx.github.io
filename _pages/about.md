Hello! I am Yujia Xiao, a third-year PhD student in the DSP & Speech Technology Laboratory (DSP-STL) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of Prof. Tan Lee. Prior to this, I worked as an applied scientist at Microsoft from 2018 to 2022. I earned both my M.S. and B.S. degrees from South China University of Technology. My current research focuses on long-form audio and speech generation as well as multimodal agents. If you are interested in my work, feel free to contact me!
